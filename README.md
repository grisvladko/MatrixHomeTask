# MatrixHomeTask

This project is a home assignment for Matrix. 
displays a local json in a tableView, each section of which contains a collectionView.
scrolling varies depending on the tab you choose.

note: i specifically didn't want to use cocoapods, because this project is very basic and there is no need to make pods.
also, used UICollectionViewFlowLayout subclasses instead of UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout to support versions prior to ios 13.
the application has no main storyboard, all the ui is programatic.
